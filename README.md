üìö multilingual-rag-bangla

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that supports both English and Bangla queries. It retrieves context from the HSC 2026 Bangla 1st Paper textbook and generates meaningful, grounded answers.

The system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines:

    * MultiVectorRetriever and ParentDocumentRetriever for semantic retrieval of dense text chunks,

    * BM25 for sparse, keyword-based search to enhance precision on short or exact-match queries.

Document embeddings are stored and queried using FAISS as the vector store. For PDF preprocessing, the system uses the multilingual-pdf2text module, which integrates Tesseract OCR with Bengali language support (tesseract-ocr-ben) to accurately extract text from scanned or image-based PDFs.

Communication between backend and frontend is handled via FastAPI WebSocket, which manages conversation memory by maintaining a 2‚Äì3 message history for context. This memory can be expanded by integrating a database for persistent and scalable context retention.

This architecture ensures robust retrieval and accurate response generation for multilingual educational content.
